Horiseon Project Code Factoring

When I began I just went through each item on the screen to try to determine what was and what wasn't working. I noted that the Search Engine Optimization label in the nav section to the right of the Horiseon label caused a glove to hover but caused no action when pressed. This was not the action with the other two labels next to it. I fixed this by adding the ID element as was found in the working code for the online-reputation-management and social-media-marketing sections.

I noticed that the paragraph in each of the three cards were wrapped. I had to manipulate the parameters for both the img and the paragraph text to fix this. Likewise I had to alter the parameters for the ima and text to correct some rendering issues I noticed.  This was done in the CSS file. I must admit that it still looks bad if you shorten the with of the browser you're viewing the html in. 

I added alt comments to each imp declaration so that a meaningful label will display if the img is not available. I was not able to figure out how to do it for the larger img of the team in a meeting at the top of the page.

As for Semantics; I added sections, aside, footer, and nav. I'm not sure what value this is though.
