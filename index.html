<!-- 
    This represents more than 12 hours of work. I left some commented code in to show the direction I was going in
    
    What I have not been able to accomplish
1. figure out how to leave an alt text for the marketing meeting image
2. FIXED get rid of the wrap in the p elements. I'm not convinced this is the best solution 
3. the SEO text in the hero does not navigate like the other lables.
4. get the verticle navbar bottom to match the bottom of the Social Media Marketing box
5. search window does not work

                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they
                travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase
                your visibility and <br>find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an
                internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives
                you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you
                determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and
                increase your lead generation.

        <p>

            your website.
